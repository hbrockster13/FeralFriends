# FeralFriends
An app for the feral cat community application so crazy cat ladies like 
my wife can look on a map in their local area and identify stray cats. 
This will help users communicate and collaborate on how to help local 
stray cats by feeding them, getting them proper shelter and getting them 
spayed or neutered. They can also share the progress of these cats via pictures.
The app could also be extended for other animals like dogs, birds, dragons, etc.
